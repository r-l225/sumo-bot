Define initial states and variables:
  State = SEARCH
  IR_front, IR_back = 0  // Initialize IR sensor values
  distance = 0           // Distance from ultrasonic sensor

Setup motor control and sensor initialization

Main loop:
  while (true)
    Read sensor values:
      IR_front = analogRead(IR_sensor_front)
      IR_back = analogRead(IR_sensor_back)
      distance = ultrasonic.read()

    Switch (State):
      
      CASE SEARCH:
        Rotate or move in search pattern
        If object detected (distance < 20 cm):
          Stop rotating
          Set State = APPROACH
        If boundary detected (IR_front < threshold OR IR_back < threshold):
          Set State = AVOID_BOUNDARY

      CASE APPROACH:
        Move forward towards object
        If boundary detected (IR_front < threshold OR IR_back < threshold):
          Stop moving forward
          Set State = AVOID_BOUNDARY
        If object no longer detected (distance > 20 cm):
          Set State = SEARCH

      CASE AVOID_BOUNDARY:
        If front boundary detected (IR_front < threshold):
          Stop and move backward for a short time
          Rotate to avoid boundary
          Set State = SEARCH
        If rear boundary detected (IR_back < threshold):
          Stop and move forward for a short time
          Rotate to avoid boundary
          Set State = SEARCH

      CASE STOP:
        Stop all motors
        End the state machine or perform other tasks

    End switch

End loop
